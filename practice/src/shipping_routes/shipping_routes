Input is an inputString: "US:UK:UPS:4,US:UK:DHL:5,UK:CA:FedEx:10,AU:JP:DHL:20" Format: sourceCountry:targetCountry:method:cost

Part 1:
Write a method that takes (inputString, sourceCountry, targetCountry, method) as input and outputs the cost. Concatenate sourceCountry, targetCountry, method to use as a key. Handle edge cases: what to return if the country is not found, how to handle empty strings.

Part 2:
If one intermediate country is allowed, output a structure. For example, if the input is US and CA, output:

{
route: "US -> UK -> CA",
method: "UPS -> FedEx",
cost: 14
}
No need to calculate the lowest cost; any intermediate country and method are acceptable. The cost is the sum of the two methods' costs.

Part 3:
Calculate the lowest cost with at most one hop

Part 4:
Calculate the lowest cost.
