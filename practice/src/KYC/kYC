Business Account Data Verification
Problem Requirements
You are building a system to verify new business accounts. This is a "Know Your Customer" (KYC) system. The system reads business data from a CSV string. You must decide if each account is VERIFIED or NOT VERIFIED.

You will build the solution in five steps. Each step adds a new rule:

Check for Missing Info: Make sure all fields have data.
Check Description Length: Make sure the description is the right length.
Block Bad Words: Flag businesses using forbidden generic words.
Match Business Names: Check if the name matches the description fields.
Return Specific Error Codes: Tell the user exactly why verification failed.
Input Format
You get a string formatted as a CSV (Comma Separated Values).

col1,col2,col3,col4,col5,col6
BIZ001,Pawsome Pets Inc.,pawsomepets.com,Pawsome,PAWSOME PETS INC,Premium pet supplies
BIZ002,Bean Bliss Coffee,beanbliss.com,,,Artisan coffee roasters
The first line is the header. Every line after that is a business account with 6 columns:

col1: Business ID
col2: Legal Name
col3: Website URL
col4: Short Description
col5: Full Description
col6: Product Details
Output Format
For every business (skip the header), print one line like this:

VERIFIED: <business_name>
Or like this:

NOT VERIFIED: <business_name>
You must keep the output in the same order as the input.

Part 1: Check for Missing Info
What You Need To Do
Write a function called validate_businesses(csv_data). This function checks if a business provided all the required information. A business is VERIFIED only if every field has text in it.

If a field only contains spaces, count it as empty.

Example
Input:

csv_data = """col1,col2,col3,col4,col5,col6
BIZ001,Pawsome Pets Inc.,pawsomepets.com,Pawsome,PAWSOME PETS INC,Premium pet supplies
BIZ002,Bean Bliss Coffee,beanbliss.com,,,Artisan coffee roasters
BIZ003,,,,,
BIZ004,Tech Solutions,techsol.io,Tech,TECH SOLUTIONS,Software consulting"""
Output:

VERIFIED: Pawsome Pets Inc.
NOT VERIFIED: Bean Bliss Coffee
NOT VERIFIED:
VERIFIED: Tech Solutions
Explanation:

BIZ001: Has all 6 fields. -> VERIFIED
BIZ002: Missing col4 and col5. -> NOT VERIFIED
BIZ003: Only has col1. -> NOT VERIFIED (Name is empty, so output name is blank)
BIZ004: Has all fields. -> VERIFIED
Rules
All 6 columns must have data (remove whitespace first).
Ignore the first row (the header).
Keep the order of the businesses the same.
Handle cases where the business name (col2) is missing.
Questions to Ask the Interviewer
Can I assume the CSV format is perfect, or should I check for errors?
What if a row is missing columns completely?
What do I print if the business name itself is empty?
Do special characters count as "empty"?





Part 2: Check Description Length
What You Need To Do
Update your code to check the length of the Full Description (col5). It must follow Stripe's rules. The length must be between 5 and 31 characters (inclusive).

Remove extra spaces before counting. If the length is wrong, mark it NOT VERIFIED.

Example
Input:

csv_data = """col1,col2,col3,col4,col5,col6
BIZ001,Pawsome Pets Inc.,pawsomepets.com,Pawsome,PAWSOME PETS INC,Premium pet supplies
BIZ002,Bean Bliss Coffee,beanbliss.com,Bean,Bean,Artisan coffee roasters
BIZ003,Oakridge Furniture,oakridge.com,Oak,OAKRIDGE CUSTOM WOODWORKING AND FURNITURE EMPORIUM,Custom furniture
BIZ004,Tech Solutions,techsol.io,Tech,ITCS,Software consulting"""
Output:

VERIFIED: Pawsome Pets Inc.
NOT VERIFIED: Bean Bliss Coffee
NOT VERIFIED: Oakridge Furniture
NOT VERIFIED: Tech Solutions
Explanation:

BIZ001: Length is 16. This is okay. -> VERIFIED
BIZ002: Length is 4. Too short. -> NOT VERIFIED
BIZ003: Length is 50. Too long. -> NOT VERIFIED
BIZ004: Length is 4. Too short. -> NOT VERIFIED
Rules
Remove whitespace from col5 before checking.
Length must be between 5 and 31.
Check this after checking for missing fields (Part 1).



Part 3: Block Bad Words
What You Need To Do
To stop fraud, we must block generic business names in the Full Description (col5). If col5 contains any of these words, mark the account NOT VERIFIED:

Blocked Words (Case-Insensitive):

ONLINE STORE
ECOMMERCE
RETAIL
SHOP
GENERAL MERCHANDISE
Case-insensitive means "Shop", "SHOP", and "shop" are all blocked.

Example
Input:

csv_data = """col1,col2,col3,col4,col5,col6
BIZ001,Pawsome Pets Inc.,pawsomepets.com,Pawsome,PAWSOME PETS INC,Premium pet supplies
BIZ002,Global Goods Market,globalgoods.com,Global,ONLINE STORE,Various products
BIZ003,Northwest Tech,nwtech.com,NW Tech,NORTHWEST INNOVATION TECH,Technology solutions
BIZ004,Sweet Dreams,sweetdreams.com,Sweet,SWEET DREAMS CREAMERY,Ice cream shop"""
Output:

VERIFIED: Pawsome Pets Inc.
NOT VERIFIED: Global Goods Market
VERIFIED: Northwest Tech
VERIFIED: Sweet Dreams
Explanation:

BIZ001: No bad words. -> VERIFIED
BIZ002: Contains "ONLINE STORE". -> NOT VERIFIED
BIZ003: No bad words. -> VERIFIED
BIZ004: col5 does not have bad words (we ignore col6). -> VERIFIED
Rules
Check col5 for blocked terms.
Ignore upper/lower case.
Do this check in addition to Part 1 and Part 2.
Questions to Ask the Interviewer
Do I block the word if it is part of another word? (e.g., does "WORKSHOP" count as "SHOP"?)
Are there other words to block?
Should I check other columns too?
