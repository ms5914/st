Problem Summary
You need to write code to calculate shipping costs for an online store. The cost depends on the country and the type of product.

This interview problem has three steps. It starts simple and gets harder:

Simple Fixed Price: Each item has a set price.
Volume Discounts: The price changes based on how many items you buy (tiers).
Mixed Pricing Types: Some ranges charge per item, while others charge a flat fee.
Data Format
You get two pieces of data:

1. Order Object: This tells you the country and the list of items being bought.

{
    "country": "US",
    "items": [
        {"product": "mouse", "quantity": 20},
        {"product": "laptop", "quantity": 5}
    ]
}
2. Shipping Cost Rules: This is a dictionary that holds the price rules for each country and product. The format changes slightly in each step.

Step 1: Simple Fixed Price
The Task
Write a function called calculate_shipping_cost(order, shipping_cost). It must calculate the total cost when every product has one fixed price per unit.

Example Case
Input:

order_us = {
    "country": "US",
    "items": [
        {"product": "mouse", "quantity": 20},
        {"product": "laptop", "quantity": 5}
    ]
}

order_ca = {
    "country": "CA",
    "items": [
        {"product": "mouse", "quantity": 20},
        {"product": "laptop", "quantity": 5}
    ]
}

shipping_cost = {
    "US": [
        {"product": "mouse", "cost": 550},
        {"product": "laptop", "cost": 1000}
    ],
    "CA": [
        {"product": "mouse", "cost": 750},
        {"product": "laptop", "cost": 1100}
    ]
}
Output:

calculate_shipping_cost(order_us, shipping_cost) == 16000
# Math: (20 × 550) + (5 × 1000) = 11000 + 5000 = 16000

calculate_shipping_cost(order_ca, shipping_cost) == 20500
# Math: (20 × 750) + (5 × 1100) = 15000 + 5500 = 20500
Key Requirements
Handle orders with multiple different products.
Use the correct prices for the specific country.
Return the answer as an integer (whole number).






Step 2: Volume Discounts
The Task
Update your function to handle "tiered pricing." This means the cost per unit changes based on the quantity.

Each tier has a start number (minQuantity) and an end number (maxQuantity). This works like a bulk discount—buying more units might lower the price for the extra items.

Example Case
Input:

# Orders remain the same as Part 1

shipping_cost = {
    "US": [
        {
            "product": "mouse",
            "costs": [
                {"minQuantity": 0, "maxQuantity": None, "cost": 550}
            ]
        },
        {
            "product": "laptop",
            "costs": [
                {"minQuantity": 0, "maxQuantity": 2, "cost": 1000},
                {"minQuantity": 3, "maxQuantity": None, "cost": 900}
            ]
        }
    ],
    "CA": [
        {
            "product": "mouse",
            "costs": [
                {"minQuantity": 0, "maxQuantity": None, "cost": 750}
            ]
        },
        {
            "product": "laptop",
            "costs": [
                {"minQuantity": 0, "maxQuantity": 2, "cost": 1100},
                {"minQuantity": 3, "maxQuantity": None, "cost": 1000}
            ]
        }
    ]
}
Output:

calculate_shipping_cost(order_us, shipping_cost) == 15700
# Math:
# mouse: 20 × 550 = 11000 (standard rate)
# laptop: (2 × 1000) + (3 × 900) = 2000 + 2700 = 4700
# Total: 11000 + 4700 = 15700

calculate_shipping_cost(order_ca, shipping_cost) == 20200
# Math:
# mouse: 20 × 750 = 15000
# laptop: (2 × 1100) + (3 × 1000) = 2200 + 3000 = 5200
# Total: 15000 + 5200 = 20200
Key Requirements
Process the rules in order from lowest quantity to highest.
If maxQuantity is None, it means there is no limit for that tier.
The range includes the start number but stops before the end number ( [min, max) ).
Calculate the cost for each tier separately and add them up.
Clarification Questions
Are the tiers always sorted by minQuantity?
Do the ranges include the maxQuantity number or exclude it?
Are there gaps between tiers, or do they overlap?
What should happen if the quantity is zero?



Step 3: Mixed Pricing Types
The Task
Now, the system needs to support two different ways to charge for a tier:

incremental: Charge per unit (Quantity × Cost). This is the same as Step 2.
fixed: Charge one flat fee for the whole tier, no matter how many items are in it.
A single product can mix these types. For example, the first 2 items might be a fixed fee, and the rest are per unit.

Example Case
Input:

# Orders remain the same

shipping_cost = {
    "US": [
        {
            "product": "mouse",
            "costs": [
                {
                    "type": "incremental",
                    "minQuantity": 0,
                    "maxQuantity": None,
                    "cost": 550
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "product": "laptop",
            "costs": [
                {
                    "type": "fixed",
                    "minQuantity": 0,
                    "maxQuantity": 2,
                    "cost": 1000
                },
                {
                    "type": "incremental",
                    "minQuantity": 3,
                    "maxQuantity": None,
                    "cost": 900
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "CA": [
        {
            "product": "mouse",
            "costs": [
                {
                    "type": "incremental",
                    "minQuantity": 0,
                    "maxQuantity": None,
                    "cost": 750
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "product": "laptop",
            "costs": [
                {
                    "type": "fixed",
                    "minQuantity": 0,
                    "maxQuantity": 2,
                    "cost": 1100
                },
                {
                    "type": "incremental",
                    "minQuantity": 3,
                    "maxQuantity": None,
                    "cost": 1000
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
Output:

calculate_shipping_cost(order_us, shipping_cost) == 14700
# Math:
# mouse: 20 × 550 = 11000 (incremental)
# laptop: 1000 (fixed fee for first 2) + (3 × 900) = 1000 + 2700 = 3700
# Total: 11000 + 3700 = 14700

calculate_shipping_cost(order_ca, shipping_cost) == 19100
# Math:
# mouse: 20 × 750 = 15000 (incremental)
# laptop: 1100 (fixed fee for first 2) + (3 × 1000) = 1100 + 3000 = 4100
# Total: 15000 + 4100 = 19100
Key Requirements
Check the pricing type (fixed or incremental).
Fixed: Add the cost once if the items fall into this tier.
Incremental: Multiply the quantity by the cost.
Handle patterns that switch back and forth between types.
