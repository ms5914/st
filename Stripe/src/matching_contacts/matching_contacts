At Stripe, the sales team needs to find contact information for prospective customers. Each prospective customer is defined via its main domain name.
Stripe maintains a list of emails that can be contacted. For each contact, we collect job-related information including the department they work in and their seniority.


Your task is to find matching contacts for prospective customers. For a contact to match a customer, its email domain needs to match the customer domain.

Write a program that takes a list of domains and a list of contacts, and then prints emails of all matching contacts for each input domain.


Example input:
prospects = [
    {"domain": "startup.com"},
    {"domain": "enterprise.com"}
]
contacts = [
    {"email": "zara@startup.com", "department": "c-suite", "seniority": "ceo"},
    {"email": "mariana@startup.com", "department": "c-suite", "seniority": "founder"},
    {"email": "bob@enterprise.com", "department": "HR", "seniority": "vp"},
]

Expected output:
startup.com: zara@startup.com, mariana@startup.com
enterprise.com: bob@enterprise.com

Additionally, for each prospect, we have an ordered list of preferred personas. Each persona is defined as a pair of department and seniority, concatenated with a dot. Contacts must meet a preferred persona, matching both the department and seniority, to be a good matching contact for the customer.


Update your program to include only contacts matching a preferred persona. When multiple contacts are available for a customer, they should be in the same order of the preferred personas as listed in the domains input. For each prospect, print the domain name along emails and personas of all matching contacts.


Example input:
prospects = [
    {"domain": "startup.com", "personas": ["c-suite.founder", "c-suite.ceo"]},
    {"domain": "enterprise.com", "personas": ["finance.vp"]}
]
contacts = [
    {"email": "zara@startup.com", "department": "c-suite", "seniority": "ceo"},
    {"email": "mariana@startup.com", "department": "c-suite", "seniority": "founder"},
    {"email": "bob@enterprise.com", "department": "HR", "seniority": "vp"},
    {"email": "alice@startup.com", "department": "c-suite", "seniority": "cto"},
    {"email": "christoph@enterprise.com", "department": "finance", "seniority": "vp"}
]

Expected output:
startup.com: mariana@startup.com (c-suite.founder), zara@startup.com (c-suite.ceo)
enterprise.com: christoph@enterprise.com (finance.vp)


# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
When stating preferred personas in the input, seniority or department can be a "wild card", indicating accepting any department/seniority. For example, *.vp  indicates accepting any contact with a VP seniority regardless of their department.


Update your program to handle "wild card" in preferred personas. Make sure to remove duplicates in the output.


Example input:
prospects = [
 {"domain": "startup.com", "personas": ["c-suite.founder", "c-suite.*"]},
 {"domain": "enterprise.com", "personas": ["finance.vp", "*.vp"]}
]
contacts = [
    {"email": "zara@startup.com", "department": "c-suite", "seniority": "ceo"},
    {"email": "mariana@startup.com", "department": "c-suite", "seniority": "founder"},
    {"email": "bob@enterprise.com", "department": "HR", "seniority": "vp"},
    {"email": "alice@startup.com", "department": "c-suite", "seniority": "cto"},
    {"email": "christoph@enterprise.com", "department": "finance", "seniority": "vp"}
]

Expected output:
startup.com: mariana@startup.com (c-suite.founder), zara@startup.com (c-suite.ceo), alice@startup.com (c-suite.cto)
enterprise.com: christoph@enterprise.com (finance.vp), bob@enterprise.com (HR.vp)
